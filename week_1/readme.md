Paste questions and brief writeup here
i have made first question using function diagonal and diagonal_2 where i started a for loop for the number of characters in my name as the name was converted into list earlier. as the loop started the counter gave the index number to the list of my name and it printed out the respective character. similarly for opposite diagonal i printed out spaces as (length of my word subtracted from the counter). this printed out the opposite diagonal the rest of the method wasd same.

for the second question i made out the list of dictionaries for each each student and stored the respective inputs in respective dictionaries. the counter acted as index number to access the dictionary. a table sort of thing was printed out using format option and respective spaces were given. to calculate maximum marks i took max as 0 and in the same loop to calculate which number is max ... minimum was calculated with the same method just the sign was opposite and min was initialized as 100.
sum was calculated and divided by 5 to get average


for third question i entered a song with each of its line separarted by a full stop. i then added a split function with separator as full stop so it made a list of all lines separately. then import time library and add a function time.sleep with time given as 1 second so it printed out each line in a for loop with 1 second delay.
